# I'm only going to cover ONE concept.

# Strings are immutable in memory.

# once you define a string, it is saved in memory char by char.

s = 'hello daniel'

# Python tries to save time in copying operations by defining the <string class>, <tuple class> as immutable.

# Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. 
# Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable.
